# P6 Data Visualizaiton: Koletsis Marios 

### Course Project for Udacity course 'Data Visualization and D3.js'

#### Summary

The data vizualization is a bubble chart about the performance of Facebook Ads across 6 industries "Consumer Packaged Goods",  "Ecommerce" , "Automotive",  "Professional Services", "Retail" and "Technology" described by different colours. The comparison is based on 2 basic metrics; cost per click on the Y axis and relevance score* on the X axis. The performance is also compared against the average Daily budget which is displayed by the size of the boubles on the chart. The first thing to notice is that there clearly a negative correlation between the CPC and the relevance score regardless of the industry of teh advertiser but there is no connection with the daily budget. 

*Relevance score is calculated based on the positive and negative feedback we expect an ad to receive from its target audience.

#### Design
The dataset includes performance metrics for CPM, Cost Per Click, Cost Per Link Click, Relevance Score, Industry, CTR and Daily Budget. After som EDA with R, I have decided that since the relation between cost and relevance score is similar, I sould focus on the metric with is the most comonly used CPC. Also since there is a common perseption in digital advertising that by paying more better performance follows, I think that it would be a good idea to show that this is not the case at least not in the  present dataset.
